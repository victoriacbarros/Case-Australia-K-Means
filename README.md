# Case-Australia-K-Means

## Project Description:
This project seeks to predict ideal profiles (named as personas) of accident victims since 1989, the year the traffic awareness campaign was started in Australia.


## Motivation:

The motivation of the project is to be able to predict the behavior of accident victims in Australia in order to create insights that mitigate the number of accidents and implement measures to prevent further occurrences. The Australian government is aiming to achieve the eradication of fatal accidents.


## Resources Used:

We use the python language. The packages used were pandas, pandas profiling report, numpy, seaborn, plotly  and matplotlib to help us build graphics.


## Future implementations:

The study can serve as a springboard to guide further studies with databases containing information related to the one used in the study.
